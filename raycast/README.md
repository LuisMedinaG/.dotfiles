## Raycast Preferences

You can import my Raycast preferences after installing the application:

1.  Open Raycast Preferences (`âŒ˜ ,`).
2.  Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3.  Click on **Import Settings & Data...**.
4.  Select the `.rayconfig` file that you have included in this repository (e.g., in a `raycast_backup` subfolder).

## Custom Hotkeys (Example - You'll need to fill in your actual hotkeys)

Here are some examples of the custom hotkeys I've configured within Raycast for these extensions. You can find and configure these in Raycast's Preferences under "Extensions" and then selecting the specific extension.

**Note:** Since you are planning to replace these Raycast shortcuts with `skhd`, this section is primarily for reference if you ever need to look up what you *were* using in Raycast before the transition.

* **Open Apple Notes:** `Cmd + Shift + N`
* **Open Apple Reminders:** `Cmd + Shift + R`
* **Change Case:** `Cmd + Option + C`
* **Toggle Do Not Disturb:** `Cmd + Shift + D`
* **Open Downloads:** `Cmd + Option + J`
* **Trigger Dropover:** `Ctrl + Option + Space`
* **Open Google Chrome:** `Cmd + Shift + G`
* **Search with Google:** `Cmd + Option + G`
* **Open Obsidian:** `Cmd + Option + O`
* **Open Ollama AI:** `Cmd + Shift + O`
* **Start Raytyping:** `Cmd + Option + T`
* **Set Audio Output:** `Cmd + Shift + A`
* **Play/Pause Spotify:** `Ctrl + Option + P`
* **Open Visual Studio Code:** `Cmd + Shift + V`
* **Open WhatsApp:** `Cmd + Option + W`

**(Add all your other Raycast hotkey configurations here)**

---

**Important Note:** As you transition to using `skhd` for your hotkeys (including those that currently launch applications via Raycast), you will eventually want to *disable* these corresponding hotkeys within Raycast to avoid conflicts. The goal is to have `skhd` be your single source of truth for keyboard shortcuts.
